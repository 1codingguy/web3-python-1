- install VsCode extensions:
  1. Python
  2. Solidity
- problem:
  - Solidity formatting doesn't work with prettier even following the instructions
    - needed to save install solidity plugin from npm install, so that format on save works.
    - `npm install --save-dev prettier-plugin-solidity`
      - https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity
      - it says saving prettier also, but without installing prettier from npm also works.
  - pip install doesn't work, needs `python -m pip install [package-name]`
  - "They are given rights to run Python, but not rights to run PIP. With Python, you can pass the -m flag to specify a Python module that you want to run. PIP is a Python module, so it can be passed that way."

? What is "Python black" package? same as pep8 to format code?
- problem: prettier doesn't work with Python too
- solution: use 'black' as formatter

  - so specify default formatter in setting to be null for Python:
    ```
    "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": null
    },
    ```
